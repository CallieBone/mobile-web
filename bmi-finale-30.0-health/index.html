        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> After using the calculator and you found you had a BMI between or exactly 30.0-34.9, it is very important to know about the effects this will have on your body.</p>
      
        <h1>Obesity Class I</h1>
        <p>         <p> Overweight means you have excess body weight that comes from your muscles, bone, fat and water. About 3 in 4 women (75 percent) in the United States are overweight.
          If you’re obese, your BMI is 30.0 or higher before pregnancy. Obese means you have an excess amount of body fat. About 4 out of 10 women ages 20-39 (40 percent) in the United States is obese.
          To find out your BMI, use this BMI calculator or talk to your health care provider.
          <br>
          What kinds of pregnancy complications can being overweight or obese cause?
          <br>
          Before pregnancy, if you’re overweight or obese you’re more likely than women at a healthy weight to have problems getting pregnant (also called infertility). Obesity can affect a certain kind of fertility treatment called in vitro fertilization (also called IVF). IVF is when an egg and sperm are combined in a lab to create an embryo (fertilized egg) which is then put into your uterus. The higher your BMI, the less likely it is for you to get pregnant with IVF.
          <br>
          You may also have some problems with testing like during your ultrasounds. An ultrasound is a prenatal test that uses sound waves and a computer screen to show a picture of your baby in the womb. Having too much body fat can make it difficult to see your baby by ultrasound. Checking your baby’s heart rate during labor may also be more difficult if you’re obese. 
          <br>
          If you’re overweight or obese during pregnancy, you’re more likely to have these complications:
          <br>
          High blood pressure, preeclampsia and blood clotting problems. High blood pressure is when the force of blood against the walls of the blood vessels is too high. Preeclampsia is a condition that can happen after the 20th week of pregnancy or right after pregnancy. It’s when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and signs that some of her organs, like her kidneys and liver, may not be working properly. Clotting problems are when blood clots partly or completely block the flow of blood in a blood vessel.
          <br>
          Gestational diabetes: This is a kind of diabetes that some women get during pregnancy. Diabetes is when your body has too much sugar (called glucose) in the blood. Having this during pregnancy puts you at higher risk of having diabetes after you have your baby. You’re also at risk for a milder form called insulin resistance. 
          Being pregnant past your due date and problems during labor and birth, including problems with anesthesia (pain medicine). You also may need to stay in the hospital longer after having your baby than women at a healthier weight.
          <br>
          Cesarean birth (also called c-section). This is surgery in which your baby is born through a cut that your doctor makes in your belly and uterus (womb). If you’re obese, you’re more likely to have complications from a c-section, like an infection or losing too much blood.  
          <br>
          Miscarriage or stillbirth: Miscarriage is when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Stillbirth is when a baby dies in the womb before birth but after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
          <br>
          Trouble losing your pregnancy weight after giving birth
          <br>
          If you’re obese, you’re more likely to have other complications, including:
          <br>
          Infections during pregnancy, like urinary tract infections
          A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. This is when your breathing stops while you’re sleeping.
          A dangerous blood clot problem called venous thromboembolism (also called VTE). This is when a blood clot breaks off and travels through your blood to organs like the brain, lungs or heart. This can cause a stroke or heart attack.
          Needing to go to the hospital earlier in labor, having longer labor and needing to have your labor induced. Inducing labor is when your provider gives you medicine or breaks your water (amniotic sac or bag of waters) to make your labor begin.
          Problems with breastfeeding.
          During labor, too much body fat may also block the passage of your baby through the pelvis. </p>
