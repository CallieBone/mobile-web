          <h2> What can you do to improve your chances of having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby? </h2>
<p>Before pregnancy, get a preconception checkup. This is a medical checkup you get before pregnancy. Your health care provider can help you find ways to eat healthy and be physically active to help you lose weight before you get pregnant. Losing weight before pregnancy is good for both you and your baby. If you’re thinking about weight-loss surgery, talk to your provider about your options and how long to wait after the surgery before you get pregnant.
<br>
<br>
  <strong>During pregnancy, do these things to help keep you and your baby healthy:</strong></p>
          <p><ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>Get early and regular prenatal care. Prenatal care is medical care you get during pregnancy. Go to every prenatal care checkup, even if you’re feeling fine. Your provider gives you prenatal tests, like a glucose screening test for diabetes and ultrasound to get a picture of your baby in the womb. </li>
            <li>Talk to your provider about how much weight to gain during pregnancy. If you’re overweight, you want to gain about 15 to 25 pounds during pregnancy. If you’re obese, your target range is 11 to 20 pounds. These numbers are greater if you are having multiples like twins.</li>
            <li>Eat healthy foods. Talk to your provider or a nutritionist to help you plan your meals. Check out choosemyplate.gov from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It can help you make a healthy eating plan based on your age, weight, height and physical activity. It also has a special section just for pregnant women.</li>
          <li>Don't diet. Some diets can reduce the nutrients your baby needs to grow and develop. Don’t try to stay at the same weight or lose weight during pregnancy.</li>
         <li>Do something active every day. Talk to your provider about activities that are safe for you.</li>
       <li>Talk to your provider about how you can be monitored more closely during pregnancy if you’re overweight or obese. This can include making changes to ultrasound tests and screening for sleep apnea. </li>
