    <h1>Teen prgenancy</h1>
    <p> Teenage pregnancy is pregnancy in a woman 19 years of age or younger. A woman can get pregnant if she has vaginal sex with a man at any age after she’s begun having regular monthly periods.

      According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, in 2017, around 194,000 babies were born to American girls between the ages of 15 to 19.
      
      While the number of teenage pregnancies in the United States has been in decline, it still remains higher than in other industrialized countries. </p>
    <h3> How Common is Teen Pregnancy?</h3>

    <h3> How Does Teen Pregnancy Affect Teen Parents? </h3>
    <p> Teenage pregnancy can have significant effects on adolescents, impacting their physical health, mental well-being, education, and social circumstances. Let’s explore some of these effects:

      Physical Health:
      Higher Risks: Adolescent mothers (aged 10-19 years) face higher risks of complications during pregnancy and childbirth compared to women aged 20–24 years. These risks include eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, and systemic infections.
      Babies' Health: Babies born to teenage mothers also face higher risks, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and severe neonatal conditions.
      <br>
      Mental Health:
      Postpartum Depression: Teenage mothers are at a higher risk of experiencing postpartum depression. Research shows that girls aged 15–19 experience postpartum depression at a rate twice as high as women aged 25 and older.
      Stress and Mental Health Concerns: Teen moms often face significant stress due to sleepless nights, arranging child care, and attempting to finish high school. They may also experience higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      <br>
      Education and Social Impact-
      <br>
      High School Dropout: Teen mothers are more likely to drop out of high school due to the added responsibilities of parenting.
      Economic Challenges: Without a high school diploma, teens and adults have greater difficulty securing quality employment and have lower earning potential.
      Increased Vulnerability: Adolescent girls, especially those in early adolescence, are particularly vulnerable to health consequences related to pregnancy and delivery. Child marriage and child sexual abuse also increase the risk of teenage pregnancy.
      <br>
      Global Perspective:
      <br>
      Prevalence: Globally, an estimated 21 million girls aged 15–19 years in developing regions become pregnant each year, resulting in approximately 12 million births.
      Rates of Change: While the adolescent birth rate (ABR) has decreased globally, rates of change vary across regions. Southern Asia has seen the sharpest decline, while Latin America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa continue to have high rates of teenage pregnancy1.
      Equity and Access: Reducing adolescent first births among vulnerable groups remains a challenge, leading to increasing inequity. Barriers to contraceptive access contribute to unintended pregnancies</p>

      <h3> What Are The Health Consequences of Teen Pregnancy? </h3>
      <p> A healthy pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. A baby that's delivered before 37 weeks of pregnancy is

        premature. Teen mothers are more likely to give birth to premature babies.
        
        Sometimes, these babies lack complete development in their bodies and brains. Depending on how premature the baby is, this can lead to lifelong difficulties with health and development.
        
        Premature babies also tend to be underweight. Underweight babies might have trouble breathing and feeding as infants. As adults, underweight babies are more susceptible to diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
        
        Low birth weight also affects brain development. Children who were born underweight have been observed to have learning difficulties.
        
        In addition to having an increased risk of being underweight, infants born to teenage mothers are also at a higher risk of infant mortality.</p>

    </p> Plan B One-Step is an emergency contraceptive pill taken by mouth after unprotected sex. It's used to prevent pregnancy and is commonly referred to as the morning-after pill. Here are some key points about Plan B:
<br>
    Depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle, levonorgestrel, the active ingredient in Plan B, helps prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse.
    It may prevent or delay ovulation, stop the release of an egg from your ovary, and prevent sperm from fertilizing the egg.
    If fertilization has already occurred, it may prevent the fertilized egg from attaching to the womb.
    If the fertilized egg is already implanted, Plan B won't be effective.
    <br>
    Effectiveness:
    If taken as directed within 72 hours after unprotected sex, levonorgestrel can reduce the risk of pregnancy by up to 87%.
    Taking it within 24 hours makes it even more effective.
    However, it's essential to note that Plan B is not as effective as regular contraception and should not be used as a routine birth control method.</p>
