<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> After using the calculator and you found you had a BMI less than or exactly 16.5, 18.5, or between 18.5-24.9, it is very important to know about the effects this will have on your body. </p>
        
<h1>Severely Underweight</h1>
        <p> Less than 16.5- Most women who have a low BMI in pregnancy will have a healthy pregnancy and baby are healthy, but there is an increased risk of:

          miscarriage,
          premature labour and birth (when your baby is born before they are fully developed),
          the baby having a low birth weight,
          fetal growth restriction,
          problems with your baby’s development that may affect their heart, diaphragm or stomach.
        Being less than 16.5 is considered worse since you're classification is "severe". To reduce the wish of having a child without any health complications or risking the life of yourself or unborn infant, there are some steps you can take to gain weight healthily. </p>
        <br>
        The best way to put weight on safely is to get help from a qualified healthcare professional. Your GP can check for any health conditions that may have caused weight loss and give you advice about making changes to your diet. They may also refer you to a dietitian.  

Try to gain weight gradually by eating a balanced diet, choosing from a variety of food groups, such as fruit and vegetables, starchy carbohydrates and dairy. Add protein to your meals with beans, pulses, fish, eggs and lean meat.

Try not to use sugary or high fat foods such as chocolate, cakes and sugary drinks to gain weight.

Try to build muscle with strength training or yoga. Exercise may also improve your appetite. Find out more about the benefits of exercise before getting pregnant.
        
        <h1> Underweight</h3>
        <p> If your BMI was less than 18.5 before you became pregnant you will be supported to gain more weight during pregnancy. Just like if you were less than 18.5. There's some evidence to suggest that the amount of fat you have on your body may also play a role in your fertility, regardless of your weight. If your body fat is too low, it may disrupt the flow of hormones from your brain, preventing you from releasing an egg each month.

          Some experts claim that you need to have body fat of at least 22 per cent to have normal periods. So if you're a healthy weight, but very muscular, it's possible that gaining some fat could help. However, we need more research to be sure about this. Regardless of your weight, if you're trying to get pregnant, aim to eat a healthy, varied diet consisting of:

          fruit and vegetables
          protein (meat, fish, eggs, and pulses such as beans, peas and lentils)
          dairy foods
          iron-rich foods (red meat, pulses, green vegetables and fortified breakfast cereals)
          wholegrain starchy foods (cereals, pasta and bread)
          
          It's also important to start taking a daily supplement of folic acid as soon as you start trying to conceive.
          
          If you’re worried about gaining weight, or need support to cope with an eating disorder, speak to your GP about getting the help you need.

        <h1> Normal Weight </h3>
        <p> Compared to the other BMI's above, you are the perfect BMI weight. aving a "normal" BMI, which typically falls within the range of 18.5 to 24.9, is considered beneficial for several reasons. A normal BMI is often associated with a lower risk of various health conditions and diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Maintaining a healthy BMI can also contribute to overall physical well-being, as it indicates a balanced weight that is appropriate for an individual's height and body composition.

          A normal BMI is often reflective of a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and proper self-care practices. Individuals with a normal BMI may experience improved energy levels, better cardiovascular health, and reduced risk of chronic conditions associated with obesity or underweight.
          
          Furthermore, a normal BMI can positively impact mental health and self-esteem. Feeling comfortable and confident in one's body can lead to improved body image and overall well-being. It can also reduce the risk of developing eating disorders or negative body image issues associated with extreme weight fluctuations.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Women with a normal BMI are generally considered to be at a lower risk for pregnancy-related complications compared to those with underweight or overweight BMI categories.

            Maintaining a normal BMI before and during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of certain pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. Additionally, women with a normal BMI are more likely to have a healthy weight gain during pregnancy, which is important for the well-being of both the mother and the baby.
            
            Conversely, women with a BMI outside the normal range may face increased risks during pregnancy. For example, women who are underweight may have a higher risk of delivering a low birth weight baby, while women who are overweight or obese may be at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes, hypertension, or experiencing difficulties during labor and delivery.</p>
