    </div>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Ro works with state-licensed compounding pharmacies to produce compounded semaglutide. Compounding is regulated by both FDA and state boards of pharmacy. A licensed compounding pharmacy must comply with both federal and state laws, which include administrative requirements and quality standards.</figcaption>
    </p> Compounding is the process of creating a medication that’s tailored to the needs of an individual patient. For example, some patients may need a medication in liquid form when the FDA-approved drug comes in a pill. Additionally, a pharmacy can compound medications of FDA-approved drugs that are in shortage.

    Compounded drugs are prepared by state-licensed compounding pharmacies that meet FDA and state requirements, including quality standards. When compounding in compliance with federal law, compounded drugs are not subject to FDA approval and do not have to undergo safety, effectiveness, or manufacturing review.
    
    Ro is partnering with compounding pharmacies to offer compounded semaglutide that uses the same active ingredient as Ozempic and Wegovy. In addition, Ro only offers a compounded product that contains semaglutide base (the same active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and not semaglutide salts (which are not the same active ingredient as Ozempic and Wegovy).</p>
